# Gap Analysis Report

## Overview

This report identifies missing elements, unaddressed requirements, and incomplete specifications in the recipe artifacts.

## Missing Elements

### Conversion Specifications
- **Gap**: Handling of markdown footnotes not explicitly addressed
- **Impact**: Medium - Footnotes may not convert correctly
- **Recommendation**: Add footnote handling to conversion specifications

### CLI Design
- **Gap**: Error recovery and retry mechanisms not specified
- **Impact**: Low - Affects user experience
- **Recommendation**: Add error recovery options to CLI design

[... more gaps ...]

## Unaddressed Requirements

### From recipe-requirements.md
- **Requirement**: "Support for batch conversion (multiple files)"
- **Status**: Partially addressed - CLI design mentions batch but lacks detail
- **Recommendation**: Expand CLI specification with detailed batch processing

[... more unaddressed requirements ...]

## Incomplete Specifications

### PDF Conversion
- **Issue**: PDF conversion specification lacks detail on bookmark generation
- **Impact**: Medium - Affects PDF navigation
- **Recommendation**: Expand PDF specification with bookmark details

[... more incomplete specifications ...]

## Recommendations Summary

1. **High Priority**: Add footnote handling to conversion specifications
2. **Medium Priority**: Expand batch processing in CLI design
3. **Low Priority**: Add error recovery mechanisms to CLI
