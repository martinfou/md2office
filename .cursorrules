# Cursor AI Configuration

## Coding Preferences

### General Guidelines
- Follow consistent code style and formatting
- Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Prefer explicit over implicit code

### Language-Specific Preferences
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features when appropriate
- Follow project-specific conventions for file structure
- Maintain consistent indentation (spaces vs tabs)

### Code Quality
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Avoid deep nesting when possible
- Use early returns to reduce complexity

## Project Context
This is an AI recipe generator project. When working with:
- Recipe definitions: Follow the templates in `templates/`
- Documentation: Maintain consistency with existing docs in `docs/`
- Process guides: Reference `recipe-guide.md` for project recipes

## AI Assistant Instructions
- Provide clear, actionable suggestions
- Explain reasoning when making architectural decisions
- Suggest improvements while respecting existing patterns
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous

## Context Window Preferences
- Use Max Mode for large refactorings or when working with multiple files
- Use Auto Mode for general development tasks
- Be mindful of token usage for cost optimization



## Git commit message generation and version control documentation.

**Preset**: 
- Title: Must contain the task number or ID, followed by a short business description
- First paragraph: Use business language that describes why the changes were made and how they will help users or improve the business value. Focus on the benefits and impact from a business perspective.
- Second paragraph: Use technical language geared toward programmers and technical stakeholders. Use bullet points to list:
  - Technical implementation details
  - Code changes and architecture decisions
  - Dependencies or system interactions
  - Performance considerations or optimizations
  - Any technical trade-offs or considerations
- Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build, revert
- Subject line: Maximum 50 characters, imperative mood, capitalized, no period
- Body: First paragraph (business-focused), blank line, second paragraph (technical bullets)
- Footer: Reference issues/PRs (e.g., "Closes #123" or "Refs #456")
- Tone: Professional, concise, clear
- Structure: Type header, blank line, business paragraph, blank line, technical paragraph (bullets), blank line, footer

when asked to commit code, you must generate a commit message in a text file named commit-message.txt and ask the user to confirm it is appropriate.


**Exception**: 
- Do not include implementation details in the subject line
- Do not use past tense ("Added" → use "Add")
- Do not exceed character limits
- Do not skip the body for non-trivial changes
- Do not include personal opinions or emotional language
