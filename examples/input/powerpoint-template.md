## Best Practices

### Slide Structure Guidelines

- **H1**: Use once at the top for title slide
- **H2**: Use for major sections (each creates a new slide)
- **H3**: Use for subsections (may create new slide or be content header)
- **H4-H6**: Use for nested content within slides

### Content Guidelines

- Keep bullet points concise (7-10 per slide)
- Use lists for key points
- Use paragraphs for explanations
- One code block per slide
- One table per slide
- 1-2 images per slide

### Formatting Tips

- Use **bold** for emphasis
- Use *italic* for subtle emphasis
- Use `inline code` for code references
- Use [links](https://example.com) for references

## Advanced Features

### Nested Lists

  - Second level item
    - Third level item
  - Another second level item
- Back to first level
