## Why Archived?

These documents were archived because:
- They contain historical status information that may be outdated
- They were created during development phases and are no longer actively maintained
- The information may still be useful for reference but shouldn't be treated as current

## Current Documentation

For current, actively maintained documentation, see:
- [Documentation Index](../README.md)
- [User Guides](../user/)
- [Developer Guides](../developer/)
